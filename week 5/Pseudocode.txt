Pseudocode for Weekly Temperature Program

1. Initialize ArrayLists:
   - Create an ArrayList `days` to store days of the week.
   - Create an ArrayList `temperatures` to store temperatures.

2. Populate `days` ArrayList with:
   - "Monday"
   - "Tuesday"
   - "Wednesday"
   - "Thursday"
   - "Friday"
   - "Saturday"
   - "Sunday"

3. Input Loop:
   - For each day in `days`:
     - Prompt the user to enter the average temperature for the current day.
     - Store the entered temperature in the `temperatures` ArrayList.

4. User Query Loop:
   - While true:
     - Prompt the user to enter a day of the week or "week" to display the temperatures.
     - If the user enters "week":
       - Initialize `total` to 0.
       - For each day and corresponding temperature:
         - Display the day and its temperature.
         - Add the temperature to `total`.
       - Calculate `average` as `total` divided by the number of days.
       - Display the weekly average temperature.
       - Break the loop.
     - Else if the user input is a valid day in the `days` ArrayList:
       - Find the index of the input day.
       - Display the temperature for the input day using the found index.
     - Else:
       - Display an error message indicating invalid input.

5. End of program.
